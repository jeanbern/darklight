Darklight -  Web mvvm for D
====

What it is
---
A fun project to explore templates in D. 

What it isn't
---
A viable web development tool

Why?
---
The executables it generates are huge. Compilation errors are non-sensical. Most of the work being done during compilation doesn't need to be done there.


Don't judge me for this :P
